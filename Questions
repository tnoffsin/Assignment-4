Questions:
A.) The purpose of the program was to write a function that determines the percentage of customers who “RENT”, “OWN”, and “MORTGAGE” their home.

B.) The program works by calculating the percentages of customer who "Rent", "Own" and "Mortgage" their homes from a given dataset.
It begins by splitting the input data into lines and extracting the header and rows. It then goes onto identifying
the inputs of the home_ownership column. It initializes counters for each home ownership type 
and then iterates through the rows to count occurrences of each type. Finally, it calculates the
percentage of each type by dividing the counts by the total number of customers and 
multiplying by 100. The program then returns each of these percentages, providing a summary of
home ownership distribution among customers in the dataset and identifying the percentages of
all who rent, own and mortgage their homes. It is then printed out as 'RENT': 68.0, 'OWN': 20.0, 'MORTGAGE': 12.0}

C.) This program is designed to analyze a dataset to determine percentages of customers who "rent",
"own", or "mortgage" their homes. It takes a csv data as the input and splits it into individual lines
and seperates the header from the data rows. It identifies the position of the "home_ownership" column
the program then starts counting for each home ownership type and iterates through the rows to count 
the number of occurances of each type esuring accurate tallies. It goes onto calculating the percentages 
by dividing the counts by the total number of customers and multiplying by 100. The program then returns
these percentages. You just need to input your dataset or provide the dataset and it does the rest
of the calculations.
